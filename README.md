# GOANA Data Jupyter Notebook
This Jupyter Notebook shows the calculations involved in the analysis of Cas9 and Cas12a data using GOANA. Processing was done on the GOANA outputs for the Cas9 and Cas12a alignment files. GOANA  (command line) was run using default parameters except -mc flag set to 0.

To generate the supplementary figures, the data and scripts in the Comparisons folder were used. See the workflow.sh file for more information.
